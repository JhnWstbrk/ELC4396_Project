# ELC4396_Project

# This project originally involved taking input from the NEXYS4 DDR on-board microphone, and displaying the note being played. 
# After too long of trying to get the microphone to work, the project transitioned to taking frequency input from a keyboard, and displaying what note that frequency is.
